# CoinCompanions

This app is similar to Splitwise. Users can create groups for their different trips. Other users are added to the group with a code or an invitation is sent to other users. Once part of a groups, users can add expenses such as car rental, hotel cost, food cost, etc. When the trip is all said and done, users can pay whoever they owe. The app will try to minimize the amount of people the user will have to pay in order to reduce hassles between sending money to each other.
