Another Case

- our normal algorithm with result in 6 transactions
- correct number of min transactions = 4

[user_1, user_2, amount]
transactions =
[[1,5,8],[8,9,8],[2,3,9],[4,3,1]]

[-10, -8, -8, 1, 8, 8, 9]

My Algorithm:
[-1, -8, -8, 1, 8, 8, 0]
[0, -8, -8, 1, 8, 7, 0]
[0, -1, -8, 1, 8, 0, 0]
[0, 0, -8, 1, 7, 0, 0]
[0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

- this calculates 6 transactions
	- some peopel actually get more transactions than their expenses count

Correct Solution:
- person with 1 and person with 9 debt can give person with -10 (2)
- person with 8 can give to person with -8
- person with 8 can give to person with -8

min_num_transactions = 4
